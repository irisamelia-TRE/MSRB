Notes from the second client meeting:

-Expectations of success: 
	If you were able to deliver a better experience
	Just have a better user experience 
-They want us to send a quick prototype 
-They would love for us to add the nuance of multiple groups and multiple jobs
-They are expecting us to have a 5 min presentation next meeting
-Users have to understand the problem
-Have a positive user journey 
-In usability study ask people their opinions 
-Prototyping is a good idea
