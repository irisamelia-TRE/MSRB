# User Interface Prototypes

![Accumulated Pension](accumulated.png)

The main interface for exploring accumulated pension. This features an
adjustable timeline on the bottom color-coded to match with the accumulated
pension funds. The jobs are draggable and interactable similar to what is shown
in "Adding a Job". 

![Adding a Job](adding-job.png)

When there is no work in the timeline, users are prompted to add work. This
starts editing the timeline bar immediately with a contextualized pop-up.

![How Long Will the Money Last](how-long.png)
![Interacting with How Long](how-long-dragging.png)

These two show some exploratory interfaces for measuring retirement funds on a
different scale. The amount per month and the scale are all draggable as shown
in "Interacting with How Long".

![Planning Pension](planning.png)

Another possible use of this tool is as a planning device. Here the editable
paragraph is tied to prospective work with the same timeline visualization.

![Exploring Saving Goals](exploring-goals.png)

In planning, the interface can provide an explorable explanation of the
calculated pension from several perspectives. The one shown here goes back to
the how long at a certain rate the money will last.

![Exploratory Work History](work-history.png)

This presents a textual description of the user's work history allowing them to
correct errors in the program's description of their narrative.
