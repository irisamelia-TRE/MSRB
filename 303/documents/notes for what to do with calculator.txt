Ideas on what we could do with the calculator:
1. Improve the UI and UX
--- Get rid of all of the drop down boxes
2. Possibly pull user information for users that they have in their DBs instead of asking users to enter it all again

3. Increase accuracy of calculator
--- Accurate for more people
--- More accurate for the existing people

4. History of what people typed in
5. Deeplinks so people can bookmark and link to specific entries
6. Common configurations and recommendations

7. Explain concepts more and improve the english on the site
--- What do groups mean?
--- Change highest 36 consecutive months to say 3 years

8. Make the code module
--- Split up the code so the functions that work with the DOM and the code that does the math are totally different

9. Use warning shown on the page instead of alerts. Alerts are bad for many reasons - JS blockers, annoying UI, etc


Notes for the code itself:
--- It would probably be easier to call into the existing code that it would be to re-write all of the existing code. If possible lets do that, instead of trying to understand all of the existing logic.



Bugs in the existing system:
1. FIX THE TYPO in the error message THANKS CHRISTINE
2. the button to use the current date goes away on mac on chrome if you click it
