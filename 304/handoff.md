## Handing over the code
Our code will be given to the client via a zip file.
The client stated that this was their preferred method, as it is easy to do.

## Integrating the product with the client's existing website
Our product will be integrated with the client's website using an embedded IFrame.
We are using this method because it allows us to integrate our product easily without making any major changes.
